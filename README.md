# Melanoma Detection Assignment

The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the 
International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. 
Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. A solution which can evaluate images and 
alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed 
in diagnosis.


## Table of Contents
* Data Reading/Data Understanding
* Dataset Creation
* Dataset visualisation
* Model Building & training
* Choose an appropriate optimiser and loss function for model training
* Train the model for ~20 epochs
* Write your findings after the model fit, see if there is evidence of model overfit or underfit
* Choose an appropriate data augmentation strategy to resolve underfitting/overfitting Model Building 
  & training on the augmented data


## Conclusions

- The final model has a good accuracy for train and validation images which means it is able to detect and
classify the diseases accordingly.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
